This directory holds PKITS (PKI Test Suite).

The certificates and CRLs used for the tests are made by the 
NIST (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/pki/pkitesting.html), 
if the certificates are expired (for i.e.: This lib is still used after 10 
years again), you can download the certificates on the NIST's website.

- PKITS v1.0.1, posted on 2011.
